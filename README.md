# Casino-App
Hello! 
This is my casino app written in Java using IntelliJ IDEA. The java files are in the SRC folder, the class files are in the OUT folder.

I have a card class, which instaintates a single card. A card deck, which creates a standard deck of 52 cards using the card class and then shuffles the deck for the card games for the casino. I have two games, High-Low and Blackjack. Both use ArrayLists and Blackjack utilizes a stack to make sure a card isn't used twice. Each class has comments going more in depth for the classes. This zip file includes all the files needed to run the program.

I included a ExampleClass as an example main showing how to run the casino. 

The only class not used exactly is the chips, but the idea is there.
